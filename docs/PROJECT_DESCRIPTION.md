# Smart Restaurant - Project Description

## System Overview

**Smart Restaurant** is a QR-based menu ordering system for **dine-in service** that enables restaurants to:
- Manage digital menus with categories, items, and modifiers
- Generate unique QR codes for each table
- Allow customers to scan QR, browse menu, and place orders from their phones
- Customers can add items to their current order during their visit (single order per table session)
- Process payments after the meal via payment gateway integration (ZaloPay, MoMo, VNPay, Stripe, etc.) - pay-after-meal model
- Track orders in real-time via Kitchen Display System (KDS)
- View analytics and performance reports
